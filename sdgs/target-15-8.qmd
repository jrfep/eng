Invasive species pose a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem health, making their management a critical component of global conservation efforts. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.8 aims to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species on land and water ecosystems, thereby protecting and restoring natural habitats.

My research conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ileana Herrera, delves into the ecological impacts of two invasive succulent species, *Kalanchoe daigremontiana* and *Stapelia gigantea* , in semiarid regions of Venezuela. Our studies have revealed how these species alter soil nutrient cycles and affect the recruitment of native vegetation, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms driving their invasiveness and the subsequent ecological consequences.

By quantifying the effects of *K. daigremontiana* on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and examining the contrasting impacts of *K. daigremontiana* and *S. gigantea* on microbial activity in the soil and native plant recruitment, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of how invasive species can disrupt ecosystem processes. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted management actions to mitigate the adverse effects of invasive species and support the conservation of native biodiversity.

## Two contrasting invasive species

Our research has provided significant insights into the ecological impacts of two invasive succulent species, *Kalanchoe daigremontiana* and *Stapelia gigantea*, in semiarid regions of Venezuela. 

We discovered that the invasion of *Kalanchoe daigremontiana* significantly affects carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization, as well as enzymatic and microbial activities in the soil. This species increases nutrient bioavailability, which can facilitate its own invasion process.

Our comparative study revealed contrasting impacts of *Kalanchoe daigremontiana* and *Stapelia gigantea* on native seedling recruitment. While *K. daigremontiana* inhibits the recruitment of native plants through allelopathic effects, *S. gigantea* appears to facilitate the recruitment of nurse-dependent native taxa.


## Implications for Ecosystem Management

Our findings have important implications for ecosystem management and conservation strategies:

- Management Priorities: Given its significant impact on native plant communities, *Kalanchoe daigremontiana* should be a top priority for management actions. Effective control measures are essential to prevent further spread and mitigate its adverse effects on native biodiversity.

- Conservation Strategies: To protect native vegetation, it is crucial to implement strategies that promote the recruitment of native plants and manage invasive species. This includes monitoring invasive species, restoring native habitats, and engaging local communities in conservation efforts.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our research contributes valuable knowledge to the field of invasive species management and supports the goals of SDG 15.8. By understanding the ecological impacts of invasive species like *Kalanchoe daigremontiana* and *Stapelia gigantea*, we can develop more effective strategies to protect and restore ecosystems. Continued research and targeted management actions are essential to mitigate the impacts of invasive species and conserve biodiversity.
