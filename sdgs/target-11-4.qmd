## The Canaima National Park 

Canaima National Park is spread over 3 million ha in south-eastern Venezuela along the border between Guyana and Brazil. Roughly 65% of the park is covered by table mountain (tepui) formations. The tepuis constitute a unique biogeological entity and are of great geological interest. The sheer cliffs and waterfalls, including the world's highest (1,000 m), form a spectacular landscape ([UNESCO World Heritage List](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/701/)).

I have been involved in efforts to **monitor biodiversity** and environmental conditions. Using a combination of camera traps, field observations, and other technologies we have tried to track wildlife and detect ecological changes in this area [@Stachowicz_2020_Monitoring_Gran_Sabana; @Stachowicz_2024].

Involving local communities in conservation efforts is essential. **Community Engagement** through
education and awareness programs can help locals to find crucial links between better livelihoods and the preservation of nature and wildlife in the park [@Stachowicz_2020_Monitoring_Gran_Sabana]. 

We have been **advocating for policies** that protect this natural heritage site and integrates conservation goals into national and regional planning to ensure long-term protection. We have been seeking **support from international organizations** and conservation groups to provide additional resources and expertise.
