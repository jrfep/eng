The study involves field experiments replicated in 38 pastures around the world. International cooperation in scientific research was a key to address this important question at a global scale.\nDiverse dung beetle communities enhance nutrient cycling in pasturelands, which can improve soil fertility and productivity. This supports sustainable agricultural practices by maintaining ecosystem health, which are key aspects of Target 2.4.\nThe study highlights the importance of maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services even in intensified farming systems. This aligns with promoting sustainable agricultural practices that minimize environmental impact.\nProtecting dung beetle species helps maintain the balance and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems."

This understanding is essential for developing effective conservation strategies.\nThe study highlights the dual impact of human activities and ecosystem productivity on jaguar populations. This nuanced understanding helps in creating targeted interventions that address both anthropogenic pressures and environmental conditions.\nThe study’s finding that human population density alone cannot explain jaguar declines suggests that conservation efforts must be multifaceted, addressing both human and environmental factors. This holistic approach is crucial for achieving sustainable biodiversity conservation."

(2014), we developed a method to visualize and predict ecological traps, the study provides a tool to identify areas where species are at risk due to misleading habitat cues. This is crucial for preventing further biodiversity loss.\nThe study combines data on human impacts (like poaching) with environmental variables to predict the occurrence of ecological traps. This integrated approach helps in understanding the complex interactions between human activities and wildlife habitats.\nBy identifying areas with a high probability of being ecological traps, the study highlights regions that require urgent conservation action. This helps in prioritizing efforts to halt habitat degradation and biodiversity loss.\nThe study suggests further research on bear dispersal behavior and independent verification of ecological traps. It also recommends targeted education and law enforcement in high-risk areas, and increasing connectivity in safe harbor areas. These recommendations provide a roadmap for effective conservation interventions."

The sheer cliffs and waterfalls, including the world’s highest (1,000 m), form a spectacular landscape (UNESCO World Heritage List).\nI have been involved in efforts to monitor biodiversity and environmental conditions. Using a combination of camera traps, field observations, and other technologies we have tried to track wildlife and detect ecological changes in this area (Stachowicz et al. 2020; Stachowicz et al. 2024).\nInvolving local communities in conservation efforts is essential. Community Engagement through education and awareness programs can help locals to find crucial links between better livelihoods and the preservation of nature and wildlife in the park (Stachowicz et al. 2020).\nWe have been advocating for policies that protect this natural heritage site and integrates conservation goals into national and regional planning to ensure long-term protection.

    "text": "My research projects apply information technology methods to organise, access, visualise and analyse a broad range of ecological data like species distribution records, camera trap detection histories, species interactions, species traits or spatio-temporal indicators of ecosystem function. Such data feed digital knowledge bases that are fundamental for policy and management decisions.\nThey inform ecological research, policy, risk management for threatened ecosystems and species, ecosystem restoration and conservation, and natural capital accounting. Reproducibility and transparency of my research is critical for building trust among different user groups supporting evidence-based decisions, driving me to provide open access to data and workflows and encourage reusability and external validation of methods and results.\nSince my appointment at UNSW I have co-developed the Global Ecosystem Typology as a new function-based approach to understand and classify all terrestrial, freshwater, marine and subterranean ecosystems on Earth. This typology is having significant impact on policy and practice of conservation around the world, including for identifying representativeness of current ecosystems in reserves to natural capital accounting. Application of this framework helps to understand changes in the distribution and condition of ecosystems that are essential for conservation of ecosystem services and nature’s contribution to human wellbeing. My research is leading to collaborations with international research and practitioner networks leading development of ecosystem specific indicators and analytical methods. These indicators support risk assessments of ecosystems, condition measurement and quantitative synthesis of ecosystem data to inform national and global reporting on conservation and sustainable development.\n\n\nVisit the Global Ecosystems webapp\nIn my current position I aim to improve ecosystem management and restoration capacity by applying these frameworks in an Australian context to track biodiversity outcomes effectively. This work spans terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems across landscapes managed by public, private and indigenous organisations in New South Wales.\nI am also working on management of threats to ecosystems. Bush fire regimes have proved to be a critical aspect of terrestrial ecosystem management in recent years, yet the knowledge base is fragmented and dispersed with limited accessibility to fire managers and researchers. To address this problem, I am leading the development of a Fire ecology traits database for plants, which will synthesize existing knowledge on the diversity of the responses of plant species to fires events. This new digital platform is founded on plant demographic processes and links spatiotemporally explicit observations on plant response to fire events and environmental conditions. The database will improve capacity to predict how fire regimes structure plant communities and inform fire management strategies for biodiversity conservation.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit the Fire Ecology Traits for Plants webapp"

It aids in understanding ecosystem diversity and resilience, which is essential for developing targeted conservation strategies and monitoring ecosystem health.\nBoth tools contribute to monitoring progress towards SDG 15.4 by providing data and indicators that track changes in ecosystem health and biodiversity (Nicholson et al. 2024). This information is vital for assessing the effectiveness of conservation measures and making necessary adjustments.\nThe insights gained from these tools support the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning, development processes, and poverty reduction strategies (Bland et al. 2019).

These ecosystems ensure the continued provision of essential ecosystem services that support sustainable development and human well-being. But they are also located in areas of high human impact, where critical threats of climate change and transformation of land use are bringing natural ecosystems to the brink of collapse.\nI am specially interested in the fate of tropical glacier ecosystems. These unique cryogenic ecosystemsare disappearing fast from the top of tropical mountains due to the effects of global climate change (Ferrer-Paris et al. 2024; Ferrer-Paris and Keith 2024)."

By understanding the functional and compositional features of these ecosystems, we can better manage and protect water resources.\nThe typology supports global to local policy applications, helping to identify critical ecosystems that are essential for water purification, flood control, and maintaining water cycles. This is vital for implementing effective water management strategies (Nicholson et al. 2024).\nThe IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is the global standard for risk assessment at the ecosystem level and contributes robust science for measuring the impact of threats, and ecosystem responses to conservation measures (IUCN 2024).\nThe Red List of Ecosystems assesses the conservation status of ecosystems, identifying those at risk of collapse. This includes freshwater ecosystems that are crucial for clean water supply and sanitation. By highlighting these risks, it helps prioritize conservation efforts (Bland et al. 2019).\nIt provides a tool for monitoring the state of ecosystems and measuring the impacts of conservation measures. This ongoing assessment is essential for maintaining healthy water ecosystems, which directly supports SDG 6 targets related to water quality and availability.\nTogether, these tools provide a robust scientific basis for decision-making and policy development. They help identify which ecosystems are most critical for water-related services and which are under threat, enabling targeted conservation and restoration efforts.\nBy integrating these tools into national and global water management policies, we can ensure the sustainable use and protection of water resources, contributing directly to the achievement of SDG 6."

    "text": "Case studies\n\nTropical glaciers\nTropical glaciers play a role in the local and regional cycles of water and energy. The glaciers in the top of tropical mountains store vast amounts of freshwater in the form of ice. During warmer months, the melting ice provides a steady flow of water to rivers and streams, contributing to downstream needs for drinking water, agriculture, and hydropower.\nThese ecosystems support unique micro- and meso-biota adapted to cold environments. The meltwater from glaciers also contributes nutrients and propagules to downstream ecosystems.\nMany communities rely on glacier-fed rivers for their livelihoods, including agriculture, fishing, and tourism. The consistent water supply from glaciers is vital for these economic activities.\nDetailed spatial analyses of the rates of changes of tropical glaciers in the Andes and other tropical mountains can inform regional and local strategies for monitoring, management, and conservation, benefiting both people and nature.\nOur work supports SDG 6.6 by offering methods to evaluate and mitigate risks to water-related ecosystems, ensuring their sustainability and resilience (Ferrer-Paris et al. 2024; Ferrer-Paris and Keith 2024).\n\n\nUpland swamps in Australia\nWe studied groundwater-dependent, peat-accumulating, fire-prone wetlands known as upland swamps in southeastern Australia (Keith et al. 2023b).\nThe study investigated how underground mining affects the resilience of groundwater-dependent wetlands in southeastern Australia to landscape fires. We monitored soil moisture and compared the responses of mined and unmined swamps after fires. We found that mined swamps experienced a significant decline in soil moisture and showed strong symptoms of ecosystem collapse, such as loss of peat, reduced vegetation, and altered species composition. In contrast, unmined swamps maintained soil moisture and regenerated vigorously after fires.\nOur findings highlight the importance of early diagnosis and preventative measures to avoid ecosystem collapse due to anthropogenic stressors.\n\nCheck my contributions to other targets!"
